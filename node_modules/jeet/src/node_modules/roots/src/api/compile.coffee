class Compile

  ###*
   * Creates a new instance of the compile class.
   * 
   * - makes a new fs parser instance
   * - makes a new compiler instance
   * - makes a new instance of each extension, with error detection.
   *   this must happen every compile pass to clear lingering context
   * 
   * @param  {Function} roots - instance of the base roots class

   * Compiles the project. This process includes the following steps:
   *
   * - execute user before hooks if present
   * - parse the project, sort files into categories
   * - create the folder structure
   * - compile and write each of the files
   * - execute user after hooks if present
   * - removes any empty folders that exist after compile
   * - emit finished events

   * Creates the nested folder structure for a project. First, creates an array

      .then(-> W.map(output_paths, guard(guard.n(1), nodefn.lift(mkdirp))))

  ###*
   * Files are processed by category, and each category can be processed in
   * One of two ways: parallel or ordered. Parallel processed categories will
   * crunch through their files as quickly as possible, starting immediately.
   * Ordered categories will parallel compile all the files in the category, but
   * wait until one category is finished before moving to the next one.
   *
   * An example use for each of these is client templates and dynamic content.
   * With client templates, they do not depend on any other compile process so
   * they are a great fit for parallel. For dynamic content, the front matter must
   * be parsed then available in normal templates, which means all dynamic content
   * must be finished parsing before normal content starts. For this reason, dynamic
   * content has to be ordered so it is placed before the normal compiles.
   *
   * So what this function does is first distinguishes ordered or parallel for each
   * extension, then pushes a compile task for that extension onto the appropriate
   * stack. The compile task just grabs the files from the category and runs them
   * each through the compiler's `compile` method. Then when they are finished, it
   * runs the after category hook.
   *
   * Once the ordered and parallel stacks are full of tasks, they are run. Ordered
   * gets sequenced so they run in order, and parallel runs (surprise) in parallel.
   * 
   * @param  {Object} ast - roots ast
  ###

    ordered = []
    parallel = []

    for ext in @extensions
      extfs = if ext.fs then ext.fs() else {}
      category = if extfs.category then extfs.category else ext.category

      if typeof extfs != 'object'
        @roots.bail(125, 'fs must return an object', ext)

      # if extfs has keys, but no category, bail
      if Object.keys(extfs).length > 0 and not extfs.category and not category
        @roots.bail(125, 'fs hooks defined with no category', ext)

      if extfs.ordered
        ordered.push(((c) => compile_task.bind(@, c))(category))

  ###*
   * Sometimes extensions prevent file writes and leave behind empty
   * folders. The client templates extension is a good example. No matter
   * how it happens, there should not be any empty folders in the output,
   * so this method gets rid of them if they exist.
   *
   * The way this is done is *very* hacky, but it is the speediest way. It
   * tries to delete every folder, and if it succeeds, it means the folder was
   * empty, as trying to remove a directory with contents throws an error (which
   * we ignore using an empty callback).
