LiveScript
==========

LiveScript is a fork of coco, which is a fork of coffeescript. More info on changes and additons can be found [here](http://livescript.net/). It's compiler is unsurprisingly very similar to both coffeescript and coco, and has only three options, explained below:

- filename: used for error reporting, built in to `renderFile` in accord
- bare: compile without function wrapper
- const: compile all variables as constants
