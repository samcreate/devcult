You can think of it like the spiritual successor to [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/).\n\nBy making use of the power of pre-processors, we can now pass real fractions (or float numbers) as context that generates a percentage based width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently sized infinitely nestable gutter.\n\nCheck out [this presentation](http://corysimmons.github.io/presentations/jeet-5) to learn more about what sets Jeet above other grid systems, then enjoy one of Jeet's many pre-processor flavors:\n\n- [Stylus](stylus)\n- [SCSS](scss)\n\nWant to sandbox it right this very second? Fork some examples on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/collection/eilAH/).\n\n---\n\n##### Jeet is curated by loving hands at...\n<a href=\"http://mojotech.com\"><img width=\"140px\" src=\"https://mojotech.github.io/jeet/img/mojotech-logo.svg\" title=\"MojoTech's Hiring\"></a> <sup>(psst, [we're hiring](http://www.mojotech.com/jobs))</sup>\n\n##### Thanks\n- **[Jeff Escalante](https://github.com/jenius)** - For his patience and guidance with this project.\n- **[Gabriel Manricks](http://gabrielmanricks.com)** - For constantly helping.
